the app frontend/client side runs with: npm run dev
the backend/server side runs with: python cloud-server/server.py --mode gpu --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

functionality:
this is a faceswap app for live feed, where the frontend client sends the camera feed to the server and the server processes it then sends it back to client via websocket protocol.

the issue:
the feed from the server is lagging and freezes.

i want you to help identify where the issue lies,
i tried deploying the backend to very capable machines but the issue still the same, which made me conclude the issue is not with machine specs.

suspects:
the websocket protocol is not being able to transfer the bandwedth.
there is no buffering layer to ensure continious stream.
